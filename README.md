## Analyze census education microdata

### Geographical Analysis of Higher Education Institutions
    * Regional Distribution: Analyze the distribution of Higher Education Institutions by region and state, comparing the number of Higher Education Institutions in the capitals versus the interior.
    * Comparison between Regions: Study regional differences, such as the number of teachers and technicians or the level of education of employees (elementary, secondary, higher, etc.).
    * Analysis by Municipality and Microregion: View Higher Education Institutions by microregions and mesoregions, to identify regions with a higher density of institutions and employees.
